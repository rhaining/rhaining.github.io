I've been working at Cond&eacute; Nast since August 2007.  I started out working on the Special Projects team at Cond&eacute;Net, where we mostly built Facebook apps.  Towards the end of the summer of 2008, Cond&eacute; launched a Style.com iPhone app for the newly launched App Store, but we outsourced it to a vendor.  Deciding that I could learn Objective-C & Cocoa Touch, I embarked on a side project to build a prototype for Epicurious.  This convinced management that app development wasn't rocket science & paved the way to launch my first app: Wired.com Product Reviews. Shortly thereafter, we got the greenlight for Epicurious, which launched in April 2009. Up til this point, I was the only iOS developer at Cond&eacute; Nast.  Around this time, Cond&eacute;Net merged with the magazine side of things to form Cond&eacute; Nast Digital. A few of us decided to embark on a new, & potentially disruptive idea - to publish glossy magazines on the iPhone. I led a team of 3 developers to publish GQ's 2009 Men of the Year issue in November 2009 on the iPhone as an experiment.  Immediately after launch, our CEO insisted we keep publishing, so while we worked to incorporate an in-app purchase workflow, we published 2 other issues as single-issue apps.  With the advent of the iPad upon us, I led a team of 7 developers to create iPad versions of both Epicurious & GQ, both of which launched the same day as the iPad. We subsequently launched Vanity Fair & Glamour on the magazine platform, before the project was phased out at the end of the year in favor of the Adobe platform.  At the beginning of 2011, the Interactive Product Group was formed, consisting of 4 members across design, product, & technology. We were created based on past success in the mobile space, with the hopes of creating new brands & products that didn't necessarily fall in line with traditional lines of revenue for the company.  On June 1, we launched Idea Flight, a utility that allows a 'pilot' to share presentations, documents, designs, or any other PDF across multiple iPads.  SO far we've had great feedback from both press & users, even garnering public praise from the CEO of LinkedIn & the CTO of Best Buy. The basis argument in favor of the app is to ditch both paper decks & projectors, and thus allow for both high resolution as well as control over the consumption of your PDF. We even use the app for basic day-to-day stuff like meeting agendas.
